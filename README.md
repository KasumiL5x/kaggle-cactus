# Aerial Cactus Identification Competition

This is my first attempt at a CNN submission for the [Aerial Cactus Identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification/overview).

Note that this was a Kernels-only competition.  I've changed the regular Kaggle path (`../input/...`) to `./data` and unzipped the `test.zip` and `train.zip` folders (*beware: many files*).  This should work on a local machine now.

Accuracy with this model was around **0.9994**, which is pretty good!
